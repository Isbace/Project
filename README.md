# Project

root level files are files which are used in the log-in and sign-up pages
the /admin folder is for admin web pages
the /user folder is for the user web pages

these folders sort of function as their own little mini-websites. This allows for multiple people to work without fear of causing bugs in another's work.
the lang.js file does however get used by files both in the root and /users folder
